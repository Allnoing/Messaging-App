Messaging App

Hello everyone and welcome to my messaging app project! This is a personal project where I’m building a simple yet functional messaging platform to explore and improve my skills in frontend and backend development.

About the Project - 

This messaging app allows users to Log in with a username and password, View a list of friends, Add and remove friends dynamically, & Participate in conversations with others. The app is designed with simplicity and functionality in mind while leaving room for future enhancements.

Tech Stack -

HTML, CSS, JavaScript: For building the user interface.
CSS features include:
 - A gradient background for the login screen.
 - Styled and user-friendly components for the friends list and chat interface.

Backend (Coming Soon):

 - Python (Flask) To handle user authentication, message storage, and retrieval.
 - MySQL for storing user and conversation data.

Why I’m Building This - 

I wanted to challenge myself with a project that combines both frontend and backend development. This app is a way for me to gain more experience in building dynamic web applications, managing user interactions, and integrating real-time communication.
